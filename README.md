## **Sectors and Disasters**

### In this section we were trying to understand what sectors of the market were hit during those major events, and then find out if there were any patterns to which sectors had the fastest recovery.

## DEFENSIVE VS AGGRESSIVE SECTORS
### What do you notice about the graph? 

- **Aggressive Sectors = Communications, Materials, Financials, Technology, BioTech, Semiconductor, Materials**
- **Defensive Sectors = Consumer Staples, Home Construction, Defense, Healthcare, Utilities**

- Defensive stocks had higher average returns only one time in 20 years, Aggressive stocks had higher returns in 19/20 years.



## **What sectors do you think had the best recorvery???**

### - The graph below shows the Defensive and Aggressive sectors compared to the total stock market as well as the number of people who were considered affected by the disaster along with a line for total deaths.

# Conclusion 
## Based on our groups preliminary exploratory analysis as an overall conclusion we found that despite what common knowledge might say. When the market crashes or dips, investing in industries considered "aggressive" would probably reward higher returns. We also noticed that the market is typically quick to recover from a disaster event. Meaning the faster you get in after a crash the better.
